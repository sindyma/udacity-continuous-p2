# udacity-continuous-p2
Solving the Unity banana environment using deep reinforcement learning. This repo contains a project to meet requirements for the Udacity Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

# Background
This is the second project in [Udacity's Deep RL nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). This project focuses on using DQN to solve a variant of Udacity's robot arm environment. The first variation is 1 arm and the second variation uses 20 arms to train simultaneously. The modified environment is included in this repo.
